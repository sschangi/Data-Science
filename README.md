# Data-Science
This reop contains the codes and documentations for the Udacity Data Science nanodegree project. In this project, we aim to **write a Data Scientist Blog Post** analyzing the data set for [Seattle Airbnb Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).

We particularly answer the following questions:
- How much Airbnb homes are earning in certain time frames and areas?
- What are the properties helping to predict price?
- Can we find the lisings with positive and negative reviews?
