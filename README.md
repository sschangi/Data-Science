# Data-Science
This repo contains the codes and documentations for the Udacity Data Science nanodegree projects. 

## Project: Write a Data Scientist Blog Post
In this project, we aim to **write a Data Scientist Blog Post** analyzing the data set for [Seattle Airbnb Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).

We particularly answer the following questions:
- How much Airbnb homes are earning in certain time frames and areas?
- What are the properties helping to predict price?
- Can we find the lisings with positive and negative reviews?

For a summary of the analysis see the post [How to choose an airbnb place in Seattle?](https://medium.com/@schangiz2002/how-to-choose-an-airbnb-place-in-seattle-556e04dba571)

## Project: Disaster Response Project
In this Project, we use a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. By creating a machine learning pipeline, we categorize these events so that one can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The files and scripts are located in the [Project-Disaster-Response-Pipeline](https://github.com/sschangi/Data-Science/tree/main/Project-Disaster-Response-Pipeline) folder.

## Project: Recommendations with IBM
In this project, we analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the [IBM Watson Studio platform](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/login), and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. The files and scripts are located in the [Project-Recommendation-Engine](https://github.com/sschangi/Data-Science/tree/main/Project-Recommendation-Engine) folder.
