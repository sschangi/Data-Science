This Repo contains the files and scripts for the Udacity `Disaster Response Project` project.
In this Project, you use a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. By creating a machine learning pipeline, we categorize these events so that one can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.
